## 🎮 How to Play
- Each round, you and the bot face the choice: **Share** or **Keep** the biscuit.  
- Sharing builds trust, but might leave you with less.  
- Keeping gives you the whole biscuit — but risks breaking trust.  
- The bot has its own **trust level** that changes depending on your choices.  
- Your goal: manage trust and risk to survive as long as you can!
